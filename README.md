# double-lamplighter-in-Aut
An implementation of double lamplighter (and some other groups) in the automorphism group of a full shift.
This is a direct Python implementation of the main construction in my paper "More on wreath products of cellular automata".
Given a pointy action by a 0-to-0 cellular automaton, it allows applying the modified action defined in the paper
to finite words. We use this to illustrate the action of the double lamplighter \Z \wr (\Z_2 \wr \Z).
